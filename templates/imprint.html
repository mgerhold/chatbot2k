    <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
    <p>
      As a service provider we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with
      general laws (§ 7 (1) TMG). According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated to monitor
      transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances indicating
      illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain
      unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a
      specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of corresponding violations, we will remove such
      content immediately.

    <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
    <p>
      Our content may contain links to external websites of third parties over whose content we have no
      control. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective
      provider or operator of the sites is always responsible for the contents of the linked sites. The
      linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents
      were not recognizable at the time of linking. A permanent control of the linked pages is not
      reasonable without concrete indications of a violation. Upon notification of violations, we will
      remove such links immediately.
